# fall17-225-cloud
Class project for COMP 225 Fall 2017

Ellipele:
We developed this project in Unity for our Software Development class at Macalester College, Fall of 2017. It’s a fun 3D game which
allows the user to “fly” in the space by dragging on a touch screen. For this game, in order to score points, you need to collect the 
cube boosts, and to fill a perfect rainbow set. Players have three lives, and lose lives if they: hit a black boost; hit lightning; ruin 
a rainbow set (duplicate a color you already have); or stay in the cloud for too long (more than five seconds, total). You will speed up 
by collecting boosts, and you get bonus points for completing the rainbow set.

Prerequisites:
If you want to contribute to this open source game, you will need Github and Unity for setting this up. If you are just thinking about 
playing it on your Android phone, the final APK file version of the app is in the repository. If you need to run it on an iPhone, you need 
to do it through unity, and build the game yourself, because iPhones do not allow third-party apps. 

Installing:
Please fork the project to your local repo, and download the project folder. Then use Unity to open the project folder.

Built With:
Unity and C#
